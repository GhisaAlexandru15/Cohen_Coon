Automatic identification of a higher order system using the Cohen-Coon method<br />
Steps:<br />
-divide each period in 15 subintervals<br />
-check if the standard deviation is less than a certain value<br />
-extend the steady state zones<br />
-interpolate the transient state inteval with a degree 10 polynomial in order to find the 28% and 63% time with more precision<br />
